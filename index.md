## Hi there!

I am a researcher at Heidelberg University's [Research Center for Environmental Economics](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/environmental-economics). I study the economics of low-cost environmental sensors and behavioral responses to environmental health risks using field experimental and quasi-experimental methods.

## In Progress

1. Now It's Personal: A Field Experiment on the Demand for Wearable Air Quality Sensors with US Early Adopters (with Timo Goeschl)

><span style="font-size:8pt">Wearable air quality sensors offer consumers the ability to monitor and respond to personal pollution exposure in real-time, potentially informing behavioral responses to health risks and supplying novel data that can be used to assess population exposure to harmful pollutants. In partnership with a leading manufacturer, we conduct a field experiment in the United States to study demand, use, and impacts of this emerging technology among early adopters. Through a point-of-sale survey and a pricing experiment, we find that mean willingness-to-pay falls short of current market prices, and advantaged groups dominate prospective and actual customer bases. Leveraging natural variation in ambient air quality, we show that demand and user activity increase during unhealthy pollution events. Limited follow-up data suggests that adopters update their beliefs about pollution exposure, substitute public air quality information with private sensor data, and maintain the frequency of defensive behaviors. Our results provide valuable insights for developing pollution monitoring systems and highlight the importance of equitable access to environmental information and adaptation opportunities</span>
