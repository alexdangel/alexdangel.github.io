## Hi there!

I am a researcher at Heidelberg University's [Research Center for Environmental Economics](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/en/research/environmental-economics). I study air quality sensors and behavioral responses to pollution risks using field experimental, spatial, and quasi-experimental methods.
